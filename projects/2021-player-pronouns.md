## About

Player pronouns is a Minecraft mod for the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) modloaders, which adds server-side support for players to share their pronouns. Pronouns can be displayed using any mod that implements the [TextPlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/Patbox/TextPlaceholderAPI), including [Styled Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/styled-chat) and [Styled Player List](https://modrinth.com/mod/styledplayerlist).
