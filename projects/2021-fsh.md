A custom prompt for the fish shell.
---
# fsh

`fsh` is my custom prompt for the `fish` shell (although you could probably get it to work with others), written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/). Its based on quite a few other shell prompts, including [queer/p](https://github.com/queer/p), [half-life](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/half-life.zsh-theme) for Oh My Zsh, and the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/)

## Links

You can find `fsh` in some of these places on the interwebs:
- [GitHub (source code)](github://ashhhleyyy/fsh)
