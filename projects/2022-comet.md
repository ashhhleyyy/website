This was my first proper adventure into [React Native](https://react-native.dev); I used [Expo](https://expo.dev) for the base project, and [react-query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/) for storage/data fetching. It can load comics from [ComicFury](https://comicfury.com), and save metadata locally, although the interface is not polished, and the pages themselves aren't downloaded.

## Links

You can find Comet in some of these places on the interwebs:
- [Gitea (source code)](https://git.ashhhleyyy.dev/ash/comet)
