Nucleoid is a project working on building an open-source minigames server for Minecraft. I'm an Administrator, and I help keep the server running and work on the [website/API backend](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/nucleoid-backend), which is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/), as well as the [mods](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/nucleoid-extras) and [libraries](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/plasmid) used by the Minecraft server to interact with it, which are written in Java.
