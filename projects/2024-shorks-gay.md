## About

shorks.gay started out as a private fediverse server for myself, and then a couple of friends. It's now become a small infrastructure project for myself, providing other services for us to use, such as a matrix server. I manage all of the infrastructure, which has been through several major changes, including migrating our postgresql database, and switching to [NixOS](https://nixos.org) for server configuration.
