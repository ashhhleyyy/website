This is the third version of my website, this time built using a custom [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) backend. It uses [Askama](https://crates.io/crates/askama) templates, along with [axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) for the HTTP server, and is running on my Raspberry Pi 4. It uses markdown for content, which rendered into HTML by [comrak](https://crates.io/crates/comrak) to place into the templates. My website functions fully without JavaScript, and it is only used to add a few (fairly obvious) easter eggs.
