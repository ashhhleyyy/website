My portfolio and blog website.

# Website

This is the third version of my website, this time built using a custom [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) backend. It uses [Askama](https://crates.io/crates/askama) templates, along with [axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) for the HTTP server, and is running on my small Ubuntu VM. It uses markdown for content, which rendered into HTML by [comrak](https://crates.io/crates/comrak) and rendered into the templates. My website functions fully without JavaScript, as it is only used in a few places to enhance features, with the main use being for highlighting the active page in the navigation bar. It also features a couple of easter eggs, which are not too difficult to find ;P.
